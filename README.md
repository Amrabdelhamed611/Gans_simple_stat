# ReadME

GANS implementation in pytorch:

## Requirement 
mainly: 

* pytorch <= 1.9
* pytorch <= 3.6

also attached : 
* file `spec-file.3.8.txt` for conda environment specification using python **3.8**.
* and, file `spec-file.3.6.txt` for conda environment specification using python **3.6**.
## NOTEBOOKS :
* **Simple_linear_GAN :** implement gans with linear layers only.
* **Simple_linear_with_Batch_GAN:** implement gans with linear layers and Batch normlization.
* **DCGAN:** implement gans with conv layers and Batch normlization.
* **Spectral-Normalization-DCGAN:** implement gans with conv layers and Spectral Normalization.
* **Spectral-Normalization implementation and testing:** implementation of Spectral Normalization using weights wrapper layer. and compare my implementation results with the frame work ready made function.
